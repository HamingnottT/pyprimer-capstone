sign in form near complete
app.py and SQLAlchemy need work

- html template of it is looking as desired, need to do these things:
    1. check the username and password for match in admin table
        - if conditional possibly will be in either html or app.py
    2. need to somehow match up the username variables in both tables
    3. need a sign up option in the sign in portal - this will add a profile to the admin table
        - need to handle duplicate entries - db is covered as variable is unique but need to handle on python side for exception
        - html page for signup
