# Python Primer Capstone


# Project Description

Our project is a website forum where users can sign up, share their thoughts, and engage in the wider webspace community through various topics. This website utilizes Flask as the backend framework, which extends through Python to reach the HTML-based front end. The website is decorated using CSS and SCSS to represent a modern and clean look. User profiles and chat messages are managed a database constructed using SQLAchemy.

# Getting Started
Repo can be cloned easily using the Github Desktop app, by Git Bash, or by a dedicated IDE which supports onboard version control. 

To get started, make sure that you have installed atleast Python 3.10 to prevent version incompatibiliies. A requirements.txt is prodivided which holds all of the libraries used, but the python virtual environment included should allow this program to run right away. 

To activate the virtual environment, type in the terminal:
    If using Bash:
    $ source .venv/Scripts/activate
    
    If using windows CLI:
    > .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

To deactivate, type in the terminal:
    If using Bash:
    $ deactivate
    
    If using windows CLI:
    > .venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat

# Usage
To run the program locally, type in the terminal in the main directory:
    $ flask run
    - or -
    > flask run

Follow the information provided in the terminal which will list your assigned local IP address with an assigned local port. Copy the IP address and the Port number into your web browser and you will be in the home page to login or to sign up.

To terminate your session, simply close the open webpage and in the terminal press CTRL + C.
